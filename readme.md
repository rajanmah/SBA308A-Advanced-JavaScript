# Weather Application using JavaScript, HTML and CSS
### This is basic web application for to find out current weather based on name of the city. I have used open API from openweathermap.org. I used Fetch() method using async/await functions. 

## JavaScript

## HTML & CSS
I have used bootstrap and basic CSS to give shape for the web application.
