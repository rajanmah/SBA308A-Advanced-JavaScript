# Weather Application using JavaScript, HTML and CSS
### This is basic web application about weather. You can search current weather condition by city names. I have used open API from openweathermap.org and rapidApi. I used Fetch() method using async/await functions. 

## JavaScript
I have used two fetch method to communicate with two differnt third party APIs. The first one displays search for current weather. You can search current weather by city names in the Search Bar on the top. It gives current weather conditions, temperature, wind speed and humidity.
The second API is used to display news on climate and weather. I looped the news in row with thumbnail image, news headline and link for the full news.

## HTML & CSS
I have used bootstrap and basic CSS for better user experience while browsing this web application.
