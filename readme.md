# Weather Application using JavaScript, HTML and CSS
### This is basic web application for to find out current weather based on name of the city. I have used open API from openweathermap.org. I used Fetch() method using async/await functions. 

## JavaScript
I have used two fetch() from two differnt third party APIs. The first one displays search for current weather. You can search current weather by city names. It gives current weather conditions, temperature, wind speed and humidity.
The second API is used to display news on climate and weather. I looped the news in row with thumbnail image, news headline and link for the full news.

## HTML & CSS
I have used bootstrap and basic CSS to give shape for the web application.
